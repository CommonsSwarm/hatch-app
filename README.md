Hatch
=====

The Hatch application allows organizations to set a minimum fundraising target that must be reached during a given period of time.

#### üê≤ Project Stage: Production

The Hatch app is published to `marketplace-hatch.open.aragonpm.eth` on xDAI and Rinkeby networks. If you experience any issues or are interested in contributing please see review our [open issues](https://github.com/CommonsSwarm/hatch-app).

#### üö® Security Review Status: pre-audit

The code in this repository has not been audited.

## Initialization

The Hatch app is initialized with the following parameters:

* `TokenManager _tokenManager` is the address of the bonded token manager contract.
* `address _reserve` the address of the reserve pool contract.
* `address _beneficiary` is the address of the beneficiary to whom a percentage of the raised funds is be to be sent.
* `address _contributionToken` is the address of the token to be used to contribute.
* `uint256 _minGoal` is the min goal to be reached by the end of that hatch (in contribution token wei).
* `uint256 _maxGoal` is the goal that closes the hatch  when it is reached even if the hatch period has not ended (in contribution token wei).
* `uint64 _period` is the period within which to accept contribution for that hatch.
* `uint256 _exchangeRate` is the exchange rate at which bonded tokens are to be purchased for that hatch (in PPM).
* `uint256 _supplyOfferedPct` is the percentage of the initial supply of bonded tokens to be offered during that hatch (in PPM).
* `uint256 _fundingForBeneficiaryPct` is the percentage of the raised contribution tokens to be sent to the beneficiary (instead of the fundraising reserve) when that hatch is closed (in PPM).
* `uint64 _openDate` is the date upon which the hatch is to be open (ignored if 0).

## Roles

The Hatch app implements the following roles:

* **OPEN_ROLE**: Determines who can open the hatch.
* **CONTRIBUTE_ROLE**: Determines who can contribute to the hatch.

The Hatch app should have the following roles:

* **MINT_ROLE**, **BURN_ROLE**: It should be able to mint and burn hatch tokens in Token Manager.

## Interface

The Hatch app doesn't implement a specific front end. It uses the following [interface](https://github.com/CommonsSwarm/tec-hatch) together with the rest of the apps that make up the [Hatch template](https://github.com/CommonsSwarm/hatch-template).

## How to run Hatch locally

The Hatch app works in tandem with other Aragon applications. While we do not explore this functionality as a stand alone demo, the [Hatch template](https://github.com/CommonsSwarm/hatch-template) uses the Hatch and it can be run locally.



## Deploying to an Aragon DAO

Currently, the Hatch app repo has been deployed to rinkeby and xdai. You can use one of the following methods to install the app.

### Using the Aragon CLI

```
dao install <dao-address> marketplace-hatch.open.aragonpm.eth --env aragon:<network>
```

`network`: Network name to connect with.

Note you can only install apps on Rinkeby DAOs as the aragon CLI doesn't support xDai.

We recommend using [Frame](https://frame.sh/) to execute the command by adding the `--use-frame` flag at the end.

### Using the Aragon client in-app console

You can install the Hatch app by using the following console command:

```
install/marketplace-hatch/(...initParams)/OPEN_ROLE:<manager-address>:<grantee-address>,CONTRIBUTE_ROLE:<manager-address>:<grantee-address>
```

The `initParams` are set by separating them with a comma.

You can read more about the in-app console [here](https://github.com/aragon/client/blob/master/docs/CONSOLE.md).
