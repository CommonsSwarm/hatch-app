The Hatch application allows organizations to set a minimum fundraising target that must be reached during a given period of time.

* If the minimum goal is not reached the contributed tokens are refunded.
* If the maximum goal is reached the hatch ends immediately.
* Meanwhile the maximum goal is not reached, the fundraising continues until the end of the hatch period.
